Although numerous computer languages are used for writing computer applications, the computer programming language, 
C, is the most popular language worldwide. Everything from microcontrollers to operating systems is written in C
since it's very flexible and versatile, allowing maximum control with minimal commands.

Python has a simple syntax that makes it suitable for learning programming as a first language. 
The learning curve is smoother than other languages such as Java, which quickly requires learning 
about Object Oriented Programming or C/C++ that requires to understand pointers. Still, it's possible to learn 
about OOP or functional programming in Python when the time comes.
